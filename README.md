## Features

**Textify** offers the following features:

- **Real-time Messaging:** 
  Users can send and receive messages instantly. Once a message is sent, all connected clients are updated in real-time without needing to refresh the page.
  
- **User Authentication:**
  The app allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions using Firebase Authentication (supports Email/Password, Google, and other authentication methods).
  
- **Firestore Database Integration:**
  Messages are stored in Firestore, Firebase's real-time NoSQL database, which allows instant message synchronization across devices.
  
- **User Profiles:**
  Users can create profiles with basic information (such as their name and avatar), and this data is saved and can be updated anytime.
  
- **Mobile-Friendly UI:**
  The app is fully responsive and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. It uses React to build a smooth and seamless interface.

- **Push Notifications** (Future Implementation):
  Future versions will implement push notifications, so users will be notified when they receive new messages, even when they aren't actively using the app.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Firebase:**
  - Firebase Authentication for user login and registration.
  - Firestore Database for storing and syncing messages.
  
- **React:** 
  - React is used for building the user interface. It provides a dynamic and interactive experience by re-rendering components when the state changes.
  
- **React Router:** 
  - React Router is used for navigating between different views, like login, chat, and user profile pages.

- **CSS:** 
  - Custom styles are used for making the app visually appealing and responsive across devices.

- **React Firebase Hooks:**
  - Helps interact with Firebase more easily and efficiently by providing hooks to work with Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

- **Node.js (Optional):**
  - Node.js can be used to build any additional backend APIs if necessary, though the current version of Textify is client-side only.
